This is a [Y-Sweet](https://jamsocket.com/y-sweet) project using [Remix](https://remix.run). It was bootstrapped with [`create-y-sweet-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-y-sweet-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```sh
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the app running. If you open it in multiple windows, you'll see that all the state in the app is automatically kept in sync!

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`.
