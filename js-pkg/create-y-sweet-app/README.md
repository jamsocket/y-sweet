# Create Y-Sweet App

Get started with [Y-Sweet](https://jamsocket.com/y-sweet/) by using `create-y-sweet-app`. This tool allows you to create a new project in your choice of framework, with Y-Sweet already set up â€” fully ready to build a collaborative multiplayer app!

Create a new project by running:

```sh
npx create-y-sweet-app@latest
```

You'll be asked for the name of your project and then prompted to choose a framework.

While Y-Sweet works with any web stack, `create-y-sweet-app` includes quick-start templates for [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) and [Remix](https://remix.run).
