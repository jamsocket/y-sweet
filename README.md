**y-sweet** is an open-source server for building realtime applications on top of the [Yjs](https://github.com/yjs/yjs) CRDT library.

## Features

- Persists document data to a network filesystem or S3-compatible storage, [inspired by Figmaâ€™s infrastructure](https://digest.browsertech.com/archive/browsertech-digest-figma-is-a-file-editor/).
- Scales horizontally with a [session backend](https://driftingin.space/posts/session-lived-application-backends) model.
- Deploys as a native Linux process, or as a WebAssembly module on Cloudflare's edge.
- Provides document-level access control via client tokens.
- Written in Rust with a focus on stability and performance, building on the [blazing fast](https://github.com/dmonad/crdt-benchmarks) [y-crdt](https://github.com/y-crdt/y-crdt/) library.

## y-sweet stack

The y-sweet server can be used by any Yjs app, or you can use our opinionated stack to integrate Yjs and y-sweet into a Next.js app.

- `@y-sweet/sdk`, a TypeScript library for interacting with `y-sweet-server` from your application backend.
- `@y-sweet/react`, a React hooks library for building Yjs applications.
- A [debugger](https://y-sweet.cloud/advanced/debugger) for exploring Yjs document and presence state.

The goal of the y-sweet stack is to give developers the end-to-end developer ergonomics they would expect from a proprietary state-sync platform, **without the lock-in**.

y-sweet is MIT-licensed, and was created by [Jamsocket](https://jamsocket.com).

## Examples

Explore our [collaborative examples](https://github.com/drifting-in-space/y-sweet) to help you get started.

All examples are open source and live in this repository, within [/examples](https://github.com/drifting-in-space/y-sweet/tree/main/examples).

## Usage

Check the [vanilla js example](/examples/vanilla/) for more details.

### On the server
``` js
import { DocumentManager } from '@y-sweet/sdk'

// Pass in a CONNECTION_STRING, which you can get from running npx y-sweet@latest serve locally or from y-sweet cloud
const manager = new DocumentManager(CONNECTION_STRING)

// Get the client token from the y-sweet server. The client token is like the user's "password" to edit the "myDoc123" doc.
const clientToken = await manager.getOrCreateDocAndToken('myDoc123')
```

### On the client
``` js
import * as Y from 'yjs';
import { createYjsProvider } from '@y-sweet/client';

// Create the yjs doc and link it to the y-sweet server:
const doc = new Y.Doc();
createYjsProvider(doc, clientToken);

// Now use the doc like a normal yjs doc!
let mySharedMap = doc.getMap('thing');
mySharedMap.set("foo", 123);

// Update your UI based on `mySharedMap` changes like this, for example:
mySharedMap.observe((event) => {
  event.keysChanged.forEach((key) => {
    // do whatever you want based on the detected change:
    yourUpdateFunction(key, mySharedMap.get(key));
  });
});
```

## Y-Sweet Cloud

If you were to use the open source y-sweet server alone, you would still have to set up the infrastructure for self hosting it. With Y-Sweet cloud, every document is automatically persisted. You can link your own S3-compatible storage, or just let us take care of the details.

You can try a preview for free today by following our [quickstart](https://y-sweet.cloud/quickstart) guide.

If you are interested in being a build partner for early access to new features, please [reach out](mailto:hi@driftingin.space).

We are committed to growing y-sweet as an open-source-first project, wherever you decide to host it.
