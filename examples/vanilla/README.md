# Y-Sweet VanillaJS Demo

This demo shows how you can use Y-Sweet with a VanillaJS project.

This demo requires a connection string for a running Y-Sweet server. You can get one by creating a Y-Sweet service and generating a connection string at [app.jamsocket.com](https://app.jamsocket.com), or by [running the y-sweet server](https://github.com/drifting-in-space/y-sweet/blob/main/docs/running.md) yourself.

## How to run this demo

1. `npm install`
2. `npm run dev`
3. In another terminal, `CONNECTION_STRING=<your-connection-string> npm run server`
4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.
